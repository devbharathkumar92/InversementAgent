30. Sub-Agent Task Specification 30.1 Task Specification Objectives
    Field Specification Purpose Define and control Task Specification
    Objectives as an explicit part of Topic 30, so implementation, QA,
    operations, monitoring, and governance can use it without hidden
    assumptions. Objective Make Task Specification Objectives explicit,
    measurable, testable, traceable, reproducible where required, and
    aligned with the frozen SRS hierarchy and approved system goal.
    Requirement The system shall define, apply, record, and validate
    controls for Task Specification Objectives before the related
    artifact, workflow, decision, state, or baseline is accepted. Scope
    Applies to Task Specification Objectives and all directly affected
    requirements, agents, components, interfaces, data, configuration,
    states, evidence, tests, and governance actions; it shall not
    silently expand the frozen goal or scope. Inputs Current controlled
    SRS/version; applicable requirements and acceptance criteria;
    relevant upstream topic outputs; configuration/policy;
    agent/task/dependency state; data/test evidence; and authorized
    governance decisions. Input Source Controlled SRS/version
    repository; requirements/traceability registry; approved topic
    outputs; agent/component registry; dependency/orchestration state;
    configuration/policy stores; QA/evidence store; observability/audit
    records. Processing / Method / Rules Identify versioned inputs for
    Task Specification Objectives; validate identity, authority, scope,
    dependencies and readiness; apply explicit rules; preserve
    provenance, timestamps, state lineage and evidence; reject ambiguity
    rather than invent assumptions; record material transitions. Outputs
    Versioned and validated Task Specification Objectives
    state/specification containing identifiers, status, ownership,
    dependencies, validation results, evidence references,
    exceptions/blockers, and downstream readiness. Output Destination
    Controlled SRS/requirements repository; applicable
    implementation/test registry; evidence store;
    dashboard/observability; audit trail; and downstream handoff
    interfaces. Responsible Agent / Component Responsible Topic 30
    component/agent, with Master/Monitoring/Testing agents and
    authorized human governance involved where applicable. Prerequisites
    Required upstream topics, schemas, interfaces, permissions,
    dependencies, and preceding child conditions shall be available and
    validated. Dependencies Depends on the immutable goal, frozen
    scope/principles, applicable upstream topic outputs, approved
    technology/configuration, and governance/traceability controls.
    Dependency Type Blocking where safety, authority, scope,
    correctness, determinism, security, baseline integrity, or required
    evidence is material; otherwise downstream/read-only.
    Parallelization Eligibility Independent read-only analysis, evidence
    preparation, fixtures, non-conflicting implementation, and
    documentation may proceed in parallel after governing inputs and
    interfaces are frozen. Parallelization Restrictions No bypass of
    blocking dependencies; no conflicting authoritative writes; no
    baseline weakening; no goal/scope redefinition; no fabricated
    evidence; no silent overwrite. Technical Details Use stable IDs,
    versioned contracts, explicit states, deterministic rules where
    required, dependency links, correlation IDs, controlled
    configuration, reproducible run metadata, durable evidence, access
    control, and controlled branch/merge mechanisms. Tools / Resources
    Approved repository/version control, test framework, CI/CD,
    observability/audit tooling, schema validation, and only the
    data/API/tooling approved by Topic 7. Constraints Must remain within
    the frozen hierarchy, approved system goal, PoV scope, safety
    boundaries, permissions, and environment restrictions. Prohibited
    Actions Do not invent missing requirements, silently change
    numbering, bypass risk/approval controls, fabricate
    progress/evidence, or grant unauthorized execution authority.
    Expected Behaviour Produce deterministic, auditable, evidence-backed
    results; expose progress, blockers, failures and state; preserve
    prior validated state. Error Handling Validate inputs and
    dependencies; retry only explicitly retryable failures; isolate
    invalid outputs; preserve evidence; enter safe/blocked state when
    reliable processing is not possible. Blocked-State Conditions
    Blocked when required inputs, dependencies, authority, evidence,
    validation, safety, or interface compatibility for Task
    Specification Objectives are missing, invalid, failed, or
    unavailable. Unblocking Conditions Resume only after the blocking
    condition is corrected, dependency/state is revalidated, and
    required evidence is available. Human Escalation Escalate when the
    condition requires protected-governance authority, unresolved
    ambiguity, critical safety/security intervention, or an approval
    explicitly classified as human-required.

Topic 30 component/agent, with Master/Monitoring/Testing agents and
authorized human governance involved where applicable. Prerequisites
Required upstream topics, schemas, interfaces, permissions,
dependencies, and preceding child conditions shall be available and
validated. Dependencies Depends on the immutable goal, frozen
scope/principles, applicable upstream topic outputs, approved
technology/configuration, and governance/traceability controls.
Dependency Type Blocking where safety, authority, scope, correctness,
determinism, security, baseline integrity, or required evidence is
material; otherwise downstream/read-only. Parallelization Eligibility
Independent read-only analysis, evidence preparation, fixtures,
non-conflicting implementation, and documentation may proceed in
parallel after governing inputs and interfaces are frozen.
Parallelization Restrictions No bypass of blocking dependencies; no
conflicting authoritative writes; no baseline weakening; no goal/scope
redefinition; no fabricated evidence; no silent overwrite. Technical
Details Use stable IDs, versioned contracts, explicit states,
deterministic rules where required, dependency links, correlation IDs,
controlled configuration, reproducible run metadata, durable evidence,
access control, and controlled branch/merge mechanisms. Tools /
Resources Approved repository/version control, test framework, CI/CD,
observability/audit tooling, schema validation, and only the
data/API/tooling approved by Topic 7. Constraints Must remain within the
frozen hierarchy, approved system goal, PoV scope, safety boundaries,
permissions, and environment restrictions. Prohibited Actions Do not
invent missing requirements, silently change numbering, bypass
risk/approval controls, fabricate progress/evidence, or grant
unauthorized execution authority. Expected Behaviour Produce
deterministic, auditable, evidence-backed results; expose progress,
blockers, failures and state; preserve prior validated state. Error
Handling Validate inputs and dependencies; retry only explicitly
retryable failures; isolate invalid outputs; preserve evidence; enter
safe/blocked state when reliable processing is not possible.
Blocked-State Conditions Blocked when required inputs, dependencies,
authority, evidence, validation, safety, or interface compatibility for
Documentation Requirements are missing, invalid, failed, or unavailable.
Unblocking Conditions Resume only after the blocking condition is
corrected, dependency/state is revalidated, and required evidence is
available. Human Escalation Escalate when the condition requires
protected-governance authority, unresolved ambiguity, critical
safety/security intervention, or an approval explicitly classified as
human-required. Validation Method Validate Documentation Requirements

criteria, and relevant upstream/downstream contracts. Testing
Requirements Test normal, boundary, invalid-input, dependency-failure,
stale/inconsistent-state, recovery, authorization, and relevant
integration scenarios. Evidence Required Retain inputs, versions,
calculations/rules, outputs, test results, logs, decisions, approvals,
and trace/correlation identifiers relevant to Documentation
Requirements. Acceptance Criteria Documentation Requirements is accepted
only when required functionality/specification, validation, evidence,
dependencies, security/safety constraints, and applicable tests pass.
Failure / Rejection Criteria Reject when required evidence is missing,
rules are violated, dependencies are unresolved, output is invalid, or a
release-blocking safety/security/correctness condition fails. Recovery /
Corrective Action Correct the underlying condition, re-run affected
validation/tests, reconcile state, preserve evidence, and return only to

outputs; configuration/policy; agent/task/dependency state; data/test
evidence; and authorized governance decisions. Input Source Controlled
SRS/version repository; requirements/traceability registry; approved
topic outputs; agent/component registry; dependency/orchestration state;
configuration/policy stores; QA/evidence store; observability/audit
records. Processing / Method / Rules Identify versioned inputs for Task
Change Control; validate identity, authority, scope, dependencies and
readiness; apply explicit rules; preserve provenance, timestamps, state
lineage and evidence; reject ambiguity rather than invent assumptions;
record material transitions. Outputs Versioned and validated Task Change
Control state/specification containing identifiers, status, ownership,
dependencies, validation results, evidence references,
exceptions/blockers, and downstream readiness. Output Destination
Controlled SRS/requirements repository; applicable implementation/test
registry; evidence store; dashboard/observability; audit trail; and
downstream handoff interfaces. Responsible Agent / Component Responsible
Topic 30 component/agent, with Master/Monitoring/Testing agents and
authorized human governance involved where applicable. Prerequisites
Required upstream topics, schemas, interfaces, permissions,
dependencies, and preceding child conditions shall be available and
validated. Dependencies Depends on the immutable goal, frozen
scope/principles, applicable upstream topic outputs, approved
technology/configuration, and governance/traceability controls.
Dependency Type Blocking where safety, authority, scope, correctness,
determinism, security, baseline integrity, or required evidence is
material; otherwise downstream/read-only. Parallelization Eligibility
Independent read-only analysis, evidence preparation, fixtures,
non-conflicting implementation, and documentation may proceed in
parallel after governing inputs and interfaces are frozen.
Parallelization Restrictions No bypass of blocking dependencies; no
conflicting authoritative writes; no baseline weakening; no goal/scope
redefinition; no fabricated evidence; no silent overwrite. Technical
Details Use stable IDs, versioned contracts, explicit states,
deterministic rules where required, dependency links, correlation IDs,
controlled configuration, reproducible run metadata, durable evidence,
access control, and controlled branch/merge mechanisms. Tools /
Resources Approved repository/version control, test framework, CI/CD,
observability/audit tooling, schema validation, and only the
data/API/tooling approved by Topic 7. Constraints Must remain within the
frozen hierarchy, approved system goal, PoV scope, safety boundaries,
permissions, and environment restrictions. Prohibited Actions Do not
invent missing requirements, silently change numbering, bypass
risk/approval controls, fabricate progress/evidence, or grant
unauthorized execution authority.

Field Specification Expected Behaviour Produce deterministic, auditable,
evidence-backed results; expose progress, blockers, failures and state;
preserve prior validated state. Error Handling Validate inputs and
dependencies; retry only explicitly retryable failures; isolate invalid
outputs; preserve evidence; enter safe/blocked state when reliable
processing is not possible. Blocked-State Conditions Blocked when
required inputs, dependencies, authority, evidence, validation, safety,
or interface compatibility for Task Change Control are missing, invalid,
failed, or unavailable. Unblocking Conditions Resume only after the
blocking condition is corrected, dependency/state is revalidated, and
required evidence is available. Human Escalation Escalate when the
condition requires protected-governance authority, unresolved ambiguity,
critical safety/security intervention, or an approval explicitly
classified as human-required. Validation Method Validate Task Change
Control against its defined schema, rules, dependencies, evidence,
acceptance criteria, and relevant upstream/downstream contracts. Testing
Requirements Test normal, boundary, invalid-input, dependency-failure,
stale/inconsistent-state, recovery, authorization, and relevant
integration scenarios. Evidence Required Retain inputs, versions,
calculations/rules, outputs, test results, logs, decisions, approvals,
and trace/correlation identifiers relevant to Task Change Control.
Acceptance Criteria Task Change Control is accepted only when required
functionality/specification, validation, evidence, dependencies,
security/safety constraints, and applicable tests pass. Failure /
Rejection Criteria Reject when required evidence is missing, rules are
violated, dependencies are unresolved, output is invalid, or a
release-blocking safety/security/correctness condition fails. Recovery /
Corrective Action Correct the underlying condition, re-run affected
validation/tests, reconcile state, preserve evidence, and return only to
the last validated state where appropriate. Audit / Traceability Record
all material lifecycle events for Task Change Control, including
creation, evaluation, changes, failures, approvals, recovery, and final
status, linked by requirement/version/trace identifiers. Change Control
Changes to Task Change Control shall use controlled change request,
impact assessment, testing, approval where required, version creation,
audit logging, and post-change validation. Rationale / Assumptions This
specification preserves the user's frozen hierarchy while making the
item implementation-ready without introducing artificial child
numbering. Verification Method Independent review plus
automated/schema/test evidence shall verify that Task Change Control is
complete, consistent, traceable, testable, and correctly integrated.
