18. Paper Trading Engine 18.1 Paper Trading Objectives Field
    Specification Purpose Define and control Paper Trading Objectives as
    an explicit part of Topic 18, so implementation, QA, operations,
    monitoring, and governance can use it without hidden assumptions.
    Objective Make Paper Trading Objectives explicit, measurable,
    testable, traceable, reproducible where required, and aligned with
    the frozen SRS hierarchy and approved system goal. Requirement The
    system shall define, apply, record, and validate controls for Paper
    Trading Objectives before the related artifact, workflow, decision,
    state, or baseline is accepted. Scope Applies to Paper Trading
    Objectives and all directly affected requirements, agents,
    components, interfaces, data, configuration, states, evidence,
    tests, and governance actions; it shall not silently expand the
    frozen goal or scope. Inputs Current controlled SRS/version;
    applicable requirements and acceptance criteria; relevant upstream
    topic outputs; configuration/policy; agent/task/dependency state;
    data/test evidence; and authorized governance decisions. Input
    Source Controlled SRS/version repository; requirements/traceability
    registry; approved topic outputs; agent/component registry;
    dependency/orchestration state; configuration/policy stores;
    QA/evidence store; observability/audit records. Processing / Method
    / Rules Identify versioned inputs for Paper Trading Objectives;
    validate identity, authority, scope, dependencies and readiness;
    apply explicit rules; preserve provenance, timestamps, state lineage
    and evidence; reject ambiguity rather than invent assumptions;
    record material transitions. Outputs Versioned and validated Paper
    Trading Objectives state/specification containing identifiers,
    status, ownership, dependencies, validation results, evidence
    references, exceptions/blockers, and downstream readiness. Output
    Destination Controlled SRS/requirements repository; applicable
    implementation/test registry; evidence store;
    dashboard/observability; audit trail; and downstream handoff
    interfaces. Responsible Agent / Component Responsible Topic 18
    component/agent, with Master/Monitoring/Testing agents and
    authorized human governance involved where applicable. Prerequisites
    Required upstream topics, schemas, interfaces, permissions,
    dependencies, and preceding child conditions shall be available and
    validated. Dependencies Depends on the immutable goal, frozen
    scope/principles, applicable upstream topic outputs, approved
    technology/configuration, and governance/traceability controls.
    Dependency Type Blocking where safety, authority, scope,
    correctness, determinism, security, baseline integrity, or required
    evidence is material; otherwise downstream/read-only.
    Parallelization Eligibility Independent read-only analysis, evidence
    preparation, fixtures, non-conflicting implementation, and
    documentation may proceed in parallel after governing inputs and
    interfaces are frozen. Parallelization Restrictions No bypass of
    blocking dependencies; no conflicting authoritative writes; no
    baseline weakening; no goal/scope redefinition; no fabricated
    evidence; no silent overwrite. Technical Details Use stable IDs,
    versioned contracts, explicit states, deterministic rules where
    required, dependency links, correlation IDs, controlled
    configuration, reproducible run metadata, durable evidence, access
    control, and controlled branch/merge mechanisms. Tools / Resources
    Approved repository/version control, test framework, CI/CD,
    observability/audit tooling, schema validation, and only the
    data/API/tooling approved by Topic 7. Constraints Must remain within
    the frozen hierarchy, approved system goal, PoV scope, safety
    boundaries, permissions, and environment restrictions. Prohibited
    Actions Do not invent missing requirements, silently change
    numbering, bypass risk/approval controls, fabricate
    progress/evidence, or grant unauthorized execution authority.
    Expected Behaviour Produce deterministic, auditable, evidence-backed
    results; expose progress, blockers, failures and state; preserve
    prior validated state. Error Handling Validate inputs and
    dependencies; retry only explicitly retryable failures; isolate
    invalid outputs; preserve evidence; enter safe/blocked state when
    reliable processing is not possible. Blocked-State Conditions
    Blocked when required inputs, dependencies, authority, evidence,
    validation, safety, or interface compatibility for Paper Trading
    Objectives are missing, invalid, failed, or unavailable. Unblocking
    Conditions Resume only after the blocking condition is corrected,
    dependency/state is revalidated, and required evidence is available.
    Human Escalation Escalate when the condition requires
    protected-governance authority, unresolved ambiguity, critical
    safety/security intervention, or an approval explicitly classified
    as human-required.

implementation, and documentation may proceed in parallel after
governing inputs and interfaces are frozen. Parallelization Restrictions
No bypass of blocking dependencies; no conflicting authoritative writes;
no baseline weakening; no goal/scope redefinition; no fabricated

security/safety constraints, and applicable tests pass. Failure /
Rejection Criteria Reject when required evidence is missing, rules are
violated, dependencies are unresolved, output is invalid, or a
release-blocking safety/security/correctness condition fails. Recovery /
Corrective Action Correct the underlying condition, re-run affected
validation/tests, reconcile state, preserve evidence, and return only to
the last validated state where appropriate. Audit / Traceability Record
all material lifecycle events for Paper Trading Review, including
creation, evaluation, changes, failures, approvals, recovery, and final
status, linked by requirement/version/trace identifiers. Change Control
Changes to Paper Trading Review shall use controlled change request,
impact assessment, testing, approval where required, version creation,
audit logging, and post-change validation.

Field Specification Rationale / Assumptions This specification preserves
the user's frozen hierarchy while making the item implementation-ready
without introducing artificial child numbering. Verification Method
Independent review plus automated/schema/test evidence shall verify that
Paper Trading Review is complete, consistent, traceable, testable, and
correctly integrated. 18.30 Paper Trading Change Control Field
Specification Purpose Define and control Paper Trading Change Control as
an explicit part of Topic 18, so implementation, QA, operations,
monitoring, and governance can use it without hidden assumptions.
Objective Make Paper Trading Change Control explicit, measurable,
testable, traceable, reproducible where required, and aligned with the
frozen SRS hierarchy and approved system goal. Requirement The system
shall define, apply, record, and validate controls for Paper Trading
Change Control before the related artifact, workflow, decision, state,
or baseline is accepted. Scope Applies to Paper Trading Change Control
and all directly affected requirements, agents, components, interfaces,
data, configuration, states, evidence, tests, and governance actions; it
shall not silently expand the frozen goal or scope. Inputs Current
controlled SRS/version; applicable requirements and acceptance criteria;
relevant upstream topic outputs; configuration/policy;
agent/task/dependency state; data/test evidence; and authorized
governance decisions. Input Source Controlled SRS/version repository;
requirements/traceability registry; approved topic outputs;
agent/component registry; dependency/orchestration state;
configuration/policy stores; QA/evidence store; observability/audit
records. Processing / Method / Rules Identify versioned inputs for Paper
Trading Change Control; validate identity, authority, scope,
dependencies and readiness; apply explicit rules; preserve provenance,
timestamps, state lineage and evidence; reject ambiguity rather than
invent assumptions; record material transitions. Outputs Versioned and
validated Paper Trading Change Control state/specification containing
identifiers, status, ownership, dependencies, validation results,
evidence references, exceptions/blockers, and downstream readiness.
Output Destination Controlled SRS/requirements repository; applicable
implementation/test registry; evidence store; dashboard/observability;
audit trail; and downstream handoff interfaces. Responsible Agent /
Component Responsible Topic 18 component/agent, with
Master/Monitoring/Testing agents and authorized human governance
involved where applicable. Prerequisites Required upstream topics,
schemas, interfaces, permissions, dependencies, and preceding child
conditions shall be available and validated. Dependencies Depends on the
immutable goal, frozen scope/principles, applicable upstream topic
outputs, approved technology/configuration, and governance/traceability
controls. Dependency Type Blocking where safety, authority, scope,
correctness, determinism, security, baseline integrity, or required
evidence is material; otherwise downstream/read-only. Parallelization
Eligibility Independent read-only analysis, evidence preparation,
fixtures, non-conflicting implementation, and documentation may proceed
in parallel after governing inputs and interfaces are frozen.
Parallelization Restrictions No bypass of blocking dependencies; no
conflicting authoritative writes; no baseline weakening; no goal/scope
redefinition; no fabricated evidence; no silent overwrite. Technical
Details Use stable IDs, versioned contracts, explicit states,
deterministic rules where required, dependency links, correlation IDs,
controlled configuration, reproducible run metadata, durable evidence,
access control, and controlled branch/merge mechanisms. Tools /
Resources Approved repository/version control, test framework, CI/CD,
observability/audit tooling, schema validation, and only the
data/API/tooling approved by Topic 7. Constraints Must remain within the
frozen hierarchy, approved system goal, PoV scope, safety boundaries,
permissions, and environment restrictions. Prohibited Actions Do not
invent missing requirements, silently change numbering, bypass
risk/approval controls, fabricate progress/evidence, or grant
unauthorized execution authority. Expected Behaviour Produce
deterministic, auditable, evidence-backed results; expose progress,
blockers, failures and state; preserve prior validated state. Error
Handling Validate inputs and dependencies; retry only explicitly
retryable failures; isolate invalid outputs; preserve evidence; enter
safe/blocked state when reliable processing is not possible.

Field Specification Blocked-State Conditions Blocked when required
inputs, dependencies, authority, evidence, validation, safety, or
interface compatibility for Paper Trading Change Control are missing,
invalid, failed, or unavailable. Unblocking Conditions Resume only after
the blocking condition is corrected, dependency/state is revalidated,
and required evidence is available. Human Escalation Escalate when the
condition requires protected-governance authority, unresolved ambiguity,
critical safety/security intervention, or an approval explicitly
classified as human-required. Validation Method Validate Paper Trading
Change Control against its defined schema, rules, dependencies,
evidence, acceptance criteria, and relevant upstream/downstream
contracts. Testing Requirements Test normal, boundary, invalid-input,
dependency-failure, stale/inconsistent-state, recovery, authorization,
and relevant integration scenarios. Evidence Required Retain inputs,
versions, calculations/rules, outputs, test results, logs, decisions,
approvals, and trace/correlation identifiers relevant to Paper Trading
Change Control. Acceptance Criteria Paper Trading Change Control is
accepted only when required functionality/specification, validation,
evidence, dependencies, security/safety constraints, and applicable
tests pass. Failure / Rejection Criteria Reject when required evidence
is missing, rules are violated, dependencies are unresolved, output is
invalid, or a release-blocking safety/security/correctness condition
fails. Recovery / Corrective Action Correct the underlying condition,
re-run affected validation/tests, reconcile state, preserve evidence,
and return only to the last validated state where appropriate. Audit /
Traceability Record all material lifecycle events for Paper Trading
Change Control, including creation, evaluation, changes, failures,
approvals, recovery, and final status, linked by
requirement/version/trace identifiers. Change Control Changes to Paper
Trading Change Control shall use controlled change request, impact
assessment, testing, approval where required, version creation, audit
logging, and post-change validation. Rationale / Assumptions This
specification preserves the user's frozen hierarchy while making the
item implementation-ready without introducing artificial child
numbering. Verification Method Independent review plus
automated/schema/test evidence shall verify that Paper Trading Change
Control is complete, consistent, traceable, testable, and correctly
