40. Appendices 40.1 Glossary Field Specification Purpose Define and
    control Glossary as an explicit part of Topic 40, so implementation,
    QA, operations, monitoring, and governance can use it without hidden
    assumptions. Objective Make Glossary explicit, measurable, testable,
    traceable, reproducible where required, and aligned with the frozen
    SRS hierarchy and approved system goal. Requirement The system shall
    define, apply, record, and validate controls for Glossary before the
    related artifact, workflow, decision, state, or baseline is
    accepted. Scope Applies to Glossary and all directly affected
    requirements, agents, components, interfaces, data, configuration,
    states, evidence, tests, and governance actions; it shall not
    silently expand the frozen goal or scope. Inputs Current controlled
    SRS/version; applicable requirements and acceptance criteria;
    relevant upstream topic outputs; configuration/policy;
    agent/task/dependency state; data/test evidence; and authorized
    governance decisions. Input Source Controlled SRS/version
    repository; requirements/traceability registry; approved topic
    outputs; agent/component registry; dependency/orchestration state;
    configuration/policy stores; QA/evidence store; observability/audit
    records. Processing / Method / Rules Identify versioned inputs for
    Glossary; validate identity, authority, scope, dependencies and
    readiness; apply explicit rules; preserve provenance, timestamps,
    state lineage and evidence; reject ambiguity rather than invent
    assumptions; record material transitions. Outputs Versioned and
    validated Glossary state/specification containing identifiers,
    status, ownership, dependencies, validation results, evidence
    references, exceptions/blockers, and downstream readiness. Output
    Destination Controlled SRS/requirements repository; applicable
    implementation/test registry; evidence store;
    dashboard/observability; audit trail; and downstream handoff
    interfaces. Responsible Agent / Component Responsible Topic 40
    component/agent, with Master/Monitoring/Testing agents and
    authorized human governance involved where applicable. Prerequisites
    Required upstream topics, schemas, interfaces, permissions,
    dependencies, and preceding child conditions shall be available and
    validated. Dependencies Depends on the immutable goal, frozen
    scope/principles, applicable upstream topic outputs, approved
    technology/configuration, and governance/traceability controls.
    Dependency Type Blocking where safety, authority, scope,
    correctness, determinism, security, baseline integrity, or required
    evidence is material; otherwise downstream/read-only.
    Parallelization Eligibility Independent read-only analysis, evidence
    preparation, fixtures, non-conflicting implementation, and
    documentation may proceed in parallel after governing inputs and
    interfaces are frozen. Parallelization Restrictions No bypass of
    blocking dependencies; no conflicting authoritative writes; no
    baseline weakening; no goal/scope redefinition; no fabricated
    evidence; no silent overwrite. Technical Details Use stable IDs,
    versioned contracts, explicit states, deterministic rules where
    required, dependency links, correlation IDs, controlled
    configuration, reproducible run metadata, durable evidence, access
    control, and controlled branch/merge mechanisms. Tools / Resources
    Approved repository/version control, test framework, CI/CD,
    observability/audit tooling, schema validation, and only the
    data/API/tooling approved by Topic 7. Constraints Must remain within
    the frozen hierarchy, approved system goal, PoV scope, safety
    boundaries, permissions, and environment restrictions. Prohibited
    Actions Do not invent missing requirements, silently change
    numbering, bypass risk/approval controls, fabricate
    progress/evidence, or grant unauthorized execution authority.
    Expected Behaviour Produce deterministic, auditable, evidence-backed
    results; expose progress, blockers, failures and state; preserve
    prior validated state. Error Handling Validate inputs and
    dependencies; retry only explicitly retryable failures; isolate
    invalid outputs; preserve evidence; enter safe/blocked state when
    reliable processing is not possible. Blocked-State Conditions
    Blocked when required inputs, dependencies, authority, evidence,
    validation, safety, or interface compatibility for Glossary are
    missing, invalid, failed, or unavailable. Unblocking Conditions
    Resume only after the blocking condition is corrected,
    dependency/state is revalidated, and required evidence is available.
    Human Escalation Escalate when the condition requires
    protected-governance authority, unresolved ambiguity, critical
    safety/security intervention, or an approval explicitly classified
    as human-required.

validated. Dependencies Depends on the immutable goal, frozen
scope/principles, applicable upstream topic outputs, approved
technology/configuration, and governance/traceability controls.
Dependency Type Blocking where safety, authority, scope, correctness,
determinism, security, baseline integrity, or required evidence is
material; otherwise downstream/read-only. Parallelization Eligibility
Independent read-only analysis, evidence preparation, fixtures,
non-conflicting implementation, and documentation may proceed in
parallel after governing inputs and interfaces are frozen.
Parallelization Restrictions No bypass of blocking dependencies; no
conflicting authoritative writes; no baseline weakening; no goal/scope
redefinition; no fabricated evidence; no silent overwrite.

Field Specification Technical Details Use stable IDs, versioned
contracts, explicit states, deterministic rules where required,
dependency links, correlation IDs, controlled configuration,
reproducible run metadata, durable evidence, access control, and
controlled branch/merge mechanisms. Tools / Resources Approved
repository/version control, test framework, CI/CD, observability/audit
tooling, schema validation, and only the data/API/tooling approved by
Topic 7. Constraints Must remain within the frozen hierarchy, approved
system goal, PoV scope, safety boundaries, permissions, and environment
restrictions. Prohibited Actions Do not invent missing requirements,
silently change numbering, bypass risk/approval controls, fabricate
progress/evidence, or grant unauthorized execution authority. Expected
Behaviour Produce deterministic, auditable, evidence-backed results;
expose progress, blockers, failures and state; preserve prior validated
state. Error Handling Validate inputs and dependencies; retry only
explicitly retryable failures; isolate invalid outputs; preserve
evidence; enter safe/blocked state when reliable processing is not
possible. Blocked-State Conditions Blocked when required inputs,
dependencies, authority, evidence, validation, safety, or interface
compatibility for Change Log are missing, invalid, failed, or
unavailable. Unblocking Conditions Resume only after the blocking
condition is corrected, dependency/state is revalidated, and required
evidence is available. Human Escalation Escalate when the condition
requires protected-governance authority, unresolved ambiguity, critical
safety/security intervention, or an approval explicitly classified as
human-required. Validation Method Validate Change Log against its
defined schema, rules, dependencies, evidence, acceptance criteria, and
relevant upstream/downstream contracts. Testing Requirements Test
normal, boundary, invalid-input, dependency-failure,
stale/inconsistent-state, recovery, authorization, and relevant
integration scenarios. Evidence Required Retain inputs, versions,
calculations/rules, outputs, test results, logs, decisions, approvals,
and trace/correlation identifiers relevant to Change Log. Acceptance
Criteria Change Log is accepted only when required
functionality/specification, validation, evidence, dependencies,
security/safety constraints, and applicable tests pass. Failure /
Rejection Criteria Reject when required evidence is missing, rules are
violated, dependencies are unresolved, output is invalid, or a
release-blocking safety/security/correctness condition fails. Recovery /
Corrective Action Correct the underlying condition, re-run affected
validation/tests, reconcile state, preserve evidence, and return only to
the last validated state where appropriate. Audit / Traceability Record
all material lifecycle events for Change Log, including creation,
evaluation, changes, failures, approvals, recovery, and final status,
linked by requirement/version/trace identifiers. Change Control Changes
to Change Log shall use controlled change request, impact assessment,
testing, approval where required, version creation, audit logging, and
post-change validation. Rationale / Assumptions This specification
preserves the user's frozen hierarchy while making the item
implementation-ready without introducing artificial child numbering.
Verification Method Independent review plus automated/schema/test
evidence shall verify that Change Log is complete, consistent,
traceable, testable, and correctly integrated. 40.30 Reference Materials
Field Specification Nested Children 40.30.1 External References; 40.30.2
Technical References; 40.30.3 Regulatory and Compliance References;
40.30.4 Research References; 40.30.5 Supporting Documents Purpose Define
and control Reference Materials as an explicit part of Topic 40, so
implementation, QA, operations, monitoring, and governance can use it
without hidden assumptions. Objective Make Reference Materials explicit,
measurable, testable, traceable, reproducible where required, and
aligned with the frozen SRS hierarchy and approved system goal.
Requirement The system shall define, apply, record, and validate
controls for Reference Materials before the related artifact, workflow,
decision, state, or baseline is accepted. Scope Applies to Reference
Materials and all directly affected requirements, agents, components,
interfaces, data, configuration, states, evidence, tests, and governance
actions; it shall not silently expand the frozen goal or scope.

Reference Materials; validate identity, authority, scope, dependencies
and readiness; apply explicit rules; preserve provenance, timestamps,
state lineage and evidence; reject ambiguity rather than invent
assumptions; record material transitions. Outputs Versioned and

Final Structural Validation Gate --- Topics 16--40 • Topic numbering
16--40 preserved in exact sequence. • Parent → child order preserved. •
No artificial 20-child-per-topic rule applied. • Nested x.y.z children
are retained where supplied, including the complete Topic 40 nested
reference structure. • No child is invented solely for count balancing.
• Topic 40 remains 40.1--40.30 at top level. • 34-field contract is
treated as a specification contract, not as a hierarchy-generation rule.
• Baseline status is BASELINE-READY and remains subject to human
governance/approval.
