32. Parallel Development Plan 32.1 Parallel Development Objectives Field
    Specification Purpose Define and control Parallel Development
    Objectives as an explicit part of Topic 32, so implementation, QA,
    operations, monitoring, and governance can use it without hidden
    assumptions. Objective Make Parallel Development Objectives
    explicit, measurable, testable, traceable, reproducible where
    required, and aligned with the frozen SRS hierarchy and approved
    system goal. Requirement The system shall define, apply, record, and
    validate controls for Parallel Development Objectives before the
    related artifact, workflow, decision, state, or baseline is
    accepted. Scope Applies to Parallel Development Objectives and all
    directly affected requirements, agents, components, interfaces,
    data, configuration, states, evidence, tests, and governance
    actions; it shall not silently expand the frozen goal or scope.
    Inputs Current controlled SRS/version; applicable requirements and
    acceptance criteria; relevant upstream topic outputs;
    configuration/policy; agent/task/dependency state; data/test
    evidence; and authorized governance decisions. Input Source
    Controlled SRS/version repository; requirements/traceability
    registry; approved topic outputs; agent/component registry;
    dependency/orchestration state; configuration/policy stores;
    QA/evidence store; observability/audit records. Processing / Method
    / Rules Identify versioned inputs for Parallel Development
    Objectives; validate identity, authority, scope, dependencies and
    readiness; apply explicit rules; preserve provenance, timestamps,
    state lineage and evidence; reject ambiguity rather than invent
    assumptions; record material transitions. Outputs Versioned and
    validated Parallel Development Objectives state/specification
    containing identifiers, status, ownership, dependencies, validation
    results, evidence references, exceptions/blockers, and downstream
    readiness. Output Destination Controlled SRS/requirements
    repository; applicable implementation/test registry; evidence store;
    dashboard/observability; audit trail; and downstream handoff
    interfaces. Responsible Agent / Component Responsible Topic 32
    component/agent, with Master/Monitoring/Testing agents and
    authorized human governance involved where applicable. Prerequisites
    Required upstream topics, schemas, interfaces, permissions,
    dependencies, and preceding child conditions shall be available and
    validated. Dependencies Depends on the immutable goal, frozen
    scope/principles, applicable upstream topic outputs, approved
    technology/configuration, and governance/traceability controls.
    Dependency Type Blocking where safety, authority, scope,
    correctness, determinism, security, baseline integrity, or required
    evidence is material; otherwise downstream/read-only.
    Parallelization Eligibility Independent read-only analysis, evidence
    preparation, fixtures, non-conflicting implementation, and
    documentation may proceed in parallel after governing inputs and
    interfaces are frozen. Parallelization Restrictions No bypass of
    blocking dependencies; no conflicting authoritative writes; no
    baseline weakening; no goal/scope redefinition; no fabricated
    evidence; no silent overwrite. Technical Details Use stable IDs,
    versioned contracts, explicit states, deterministic rules where
    required, dependency links, correlation IDs, controlled
    configuration, reproducible run metadata, durable evidence, access
    control, and controlled branch/merge mechanisms. Tools / Resources
    Approved repository/version control, test framework, CI/CD,
    observability/audit tooling, schema validation, and only the
    data/API/tooling approved by Topic 7. Constraints Must remain within
    the frozen hierarchy, approved system goal, PoV scope, safety
    boundaries, permissions, and environment restrictions. Prohibited
    Actions Do not invent missing requirements, silently change
    numbering, bypass risk/approval controls, fabricate
    progress/evidence, or grant unauthorized execution authority.
    Expected Behaviour Produce deterministic, auditable, evidence-backed
    results; expose progress, blockers, failures and state; preserve
    prior validated state. Error Handling Validate inputs and
    dependencies; retry only explicitly retryable failures; isolate
    invalid outputs; preserve evidence; enter safe/blocked state when
    reliable processing is not possible. Blocked-State Conditions
    Blocked when required inputs, dependencies, authority, evidence,
    validation, safety, or interface compatibility for Parallel
    Development Objectives are missing, invalid, failed, or unavailable.
    Unblocking Conditions Resume only after the blocking condition is
    corrected, dependency/state is revalidated, and required evidence is
    available.

preserve prior validated state. Error Handling Validate inputs and
dependencies; retry only explicitly retryable failures; isolate invalid
outputs; preserve evidence; enter safe/blocked state when reliable
processing is not possible. Blocked-State Conditions Blocked when
required inputs, dependencies, authority, evidence, validation, safety,
or interface compatibility for Branch Strategy are missing, invalid,
failed, or unavailable. Unblocking Conditions Resume only after the
blocking condition is corrected, dependency/state is revalidated, and
required evidence is available. Human Escalation Escalate when the
condition requires protected-governance authority, unresolved ambiguity,
critical safety/security intervention, or an approval explicitly
classified as human-required. Validation Method Validate Branch Strategy
against its defined schema, rules, dependencies, evidence, acceptance
criteria, and relevant upstream/downstream contracts. Testing
Requirements Test normal, boundary, invalid-input, dependency-failure,
stale/inconsistent-state, recovery, authorization, and relevant
integration scenarios. Evidence Required Retain inputs, versions,
calculations/rules, outputs, test results, logs, decisions, approvals,
and trace/correlation identifiers relevant to Branch Strategy.
Acceptance Criteria Branch Strategy is accepted only when required
functionality/specification, validation, evidence, dependencies,
security/safety constraints, and applicable tests pass. Failure /
Rejection Criteria Reject when required evidence is missing, rules are
violated, dependencies are unresolved, output is invalid, or a

Field Specification Expected Behaviour Produce deterministic, auditable,
evidence-backed results; expose progress, blockers, failures and state;
preserve prior validated state. Error Handling Validate inputs and
dependencies; retry only explicitly retryable failures; isolate invalid
outputs; preserve evidence; enter safe/blocked state when reliable
processing is not possible. Blocked-State Conditions Blocked when
required inputs, dependencies, authority, evidence, validation, safety,
or interface compatibility for Automated Testing Before Merge are
missing, invalid, failed, or unavailable. Unblocking Conditions Resume
only after the blocking condition is corrected, dependency/state is
revalidated, and required evidence is available. Human Escalation
Escalate when the condition requires protected-governance authority,
unresolved ambiguity, critical safety/security intervention, or an
approval explicitly classified as human-required. Validation Method
Validate Automated Testing Before Merge against its defined schema,
rules, dependencies, evidence, acceptance criteria, and relevant
upstream/downstream contracts. Testing Requirements Test normal,
boundary, invalid-input, dependency-failure, stale/inconsistent-state,
recovery, authorization, and relevant integration scenarios. Evidence
Required Retain inputs, versions, calculations/rules, outputs, test
results, logs, decisions, approvals, and trace/correlation identifiers
relevant to Automated Testing Before Merge. Acceptance Criteria
Automated Testing Before Merge is accepted only when required
functionality/specification, validation, evidence, dependencies,
security/safety constraints, and applicable tests pass. Failure /
Rejection Criteria Reject when required evidence is missing, rules are
violated, dependencies are unresolved, output is invalid, or a
release-blocking safety/security/correctness condition fails. Recovery /
Corrective Action Correct the underlying condition, re-run affected
validation/tests, reconcile state, preserve evidence, and return only to
the last validated state where appropriate. Audit / Traceability Record
all material lifecycle events for Automated Testing Before Merge,
including creation, evaluation, changes, failures, approvals, recovery,
and final status, linked by requirement/version/trace identifiers.
Change Control Changes to Automated Testing Before Merge shall use
controlled change request, impact assessment, testing, approval where
required, version creation, audit logging, and post-change validation.
Rationale / Assumptions This specification preserves the user's frozen
hierarchy while making the item implementation-ready without introducing
artificial child numbering. Verification Method Independent review plus
automated/schema/test evidence shall verify that Automated Testing
Before Merge is complete, consistent, traceable, testable, and correctly
integrated. 32.19 Integration Testing Field Specification Purpose Define
and control Integration Testing as an explicit part of Topic 32, so
implementation, QA, operations, monitoring, and governance can use it
without hidden assumptions. Objective Make Integration Testing explicit,
measurable, testable, traceable, reproducible where required, and

Field Specification Outputs Versioned and validated Resource Contention
Handling state/specification containing identifiers, status, ownership,
dependencies, validation results, evidence references,
exceptions/blockers, and downstream readiness. Output Destination
Controlled SRS/requirements repository; applicable implementation/test
registry; evidence store; dashboard/observability; audit trail; and
downstream handoff interfaces. Responsible Agent / Component Responsible
Topic 32 component/agent, with Master/Monitoring/Testing agents and
authorized human governance involved where applicable. Prerequisites
Required upstream topics, schemas, interfaces, permissions,
dependencies, and preceding child conditions shall be available and
validated. Dependencies Depends on the immutable goal, frozen
scope/principles, applicable upstream topic outputs, approved
technology/configuration, and governance/traceability controls.
Dependency Type Blocking where safety, authority, scope, correctness,
determinism, security, baseline integrity, or required evidence is
material; otherwise downstream/read-only. Parallelization Eligibility
Independent read-only analysis, evidence preparation, fixtures,
non-conflicting implementation, and documentation may proceed in
parallel after governing inputs and interfaces are frozen.
Parallelization Restrictions No bypass of blocking dependencies; no
conflicting authoritative writes; no baseline weakening; no goal/scope
redefinition; no fabricated evidence; no silent overwrite. Technical
Details Use stable IDs, versioned contracts, explicit states,
deterministic rules where required, dependency links, correlation IDs,
controlled configuration, reproducible run metadata, durable evidence,
access control, and controlled branch/merge mechanisms. Tools /
Resources Approved repository/version control, test framework, CI/CD,
observability/audit tooling, schema validation, and only the
data/API/tooling approved by Topic 7. Constraints Must remain within the
frozen hierarchy, approved system goal, PoV scope, safety boundaries,
permissions, and environment restrictions. Prohibited Actions Do not
invent missing requirements, silently change numbering, bypass
risk/approval controls, fabricate progress/evidence, or grant
unauthorized execution authority. Expected Behaviour Produce
deterministic, auditable, evidence-backed results; expose progress,
blockers, failures and state; preserve prior validated state. Error
Handling Validate inputs and dependencies; retry only explicitly
retryable failures; isolate invalid outputs; preserve evidence; enter
safe/blocked state when reliable processing is not possible.
Blocked-State Conditions Blocked when required inputs, dependencies,
authority, evidence, validation, safety, or interface compatibility for
Resource Contention Handling are missing, invalid, failed, or
unavailable. Unblocking Conditions Resume only after the blocking
condition is corrected, dependency/state is revalidated, and required
evidence is available. Human Escalation Escalate when the condition
requires protected-governance authority, unresolved ambiguity, critical
safety/security intervention, or an approval explicitly classified as
human-required. Validation Method Validate Resource Contention Handling
against its defined schema, rules, dependencies, evidence, acceptance
criteria, and relevant upstream/downstream contracts. Testing
Requirements Test normal, boundary, invalid-input, dependency-failure,
stale/inconsistent-state, recovery, authorization, and relevant
integration scenarios. Evidence Required Retain inputs, versions,
calculations/rules, outputs, test results, logs, decisions, approvals,
and trace/correlation identifiers relevant to Resource Contention
Handling. Acceptance Criteria Resource Contention Handling is accepted
only when required functionality/specification, validation, evidence,
dependencies, security/safety constraints, and applicable tests pass.
Failure / Rejection Criteria Reject when required evidence is missing,
rules are violated, dependencies are unresolved, output is invalid, or a
release-blocking safety/security/correctness condition fails. Recovery /
Corrective Action Correct the underlying condition, re-run affected
validation/tests, reconcile state, preserve evidence, and return only to
the last validated state where appropriate. Audit / Traceability Record
all material lifecycle events for Resource Contention Handling,
including creation, evaluation, changes, failures, approvals, recovery,
and final status, linked by requirement/version/trace identifiers.
Change Control Changes to Resource Contention Handling shall use
controlled change request, impact assessment, testing, approval where
required, version creation, audit logging, and post-change validation.

item implementation-ready without introducing artificial child
numbering. Verification Method Independent review plus
automated/schema/test evidence shall verify that Final Integration
Readiness is complete, consistent, traceable, testable, and correctly
integrated. 32.30 Parallel Development Change Control Field
Specification Purpose Define and control Parallel Development Change
Control as an explicit part of Topic 32, so implementation, QA,
operations, monitoring, and governance can use it without hidden
assumptions. Objective Make Parallel Development Change Control
explicit, measurable, testable, traceable, reproducible where required,
and aligned with the frozen SRS hierarchy and approved system goal.
Requirement The system shall define, apply, record, and validate
controls for Parallel Development Change Control before the related
artifact, workflow, decision, state, or baseline is accepted. Scope
Applies to Parallel Development Change Control and all directly affected
requirements, agents, components, interfaces, data, configuration,
states, evidence, tests, and governance actions; it shall not silently
expand the frozen goal or scope. Inputs Current controlled SRS/version;
applicable requirements and acceptance criteria; relevant upstream topic
outputs; configuration/policy; agent/task/dependency state; data/test
evidence; and authorized governance decisions. Input Source Controlled
SRS/version repository; requirements/traceability registry; approved
topic outputs; agent/component registry; dependency/orchestration state;
configuration/policy stores; QA/evidence store; observability/audit
records. Processing / Method / Rules Identify versioned inputs for
Parallel Development Change Control; validate identity, authority,
scope, dependencies and readiness; apply explicit rules; preserve
provenance, timestamps, state lineage and evidence; reject ambiguity
rather than invent assumptions; record material transitions. Outputs
Versioned and validated Parallel Development Change Control
state/specification containing identifiers, status, ownership,
dependencies, validation results, evidence references,
exceptions/blockers, and downstream readiness. Output Destination
Controlled SRS/requirements repository; applicable implementation/test
registry; evidence store; dashboard/observability; audit trail; and
downstream handoff interfaces. Responsible Agent / Component Responsible
Topic 32 component/agent, with Master/Monitoring/Testing agents and
authorized human governance involved where applicable. Prerequisites
Required upstream topics, schemas, interfaces, permissions,
dependencies, and preceding child conditions shall be available and
validated. Dependencies Depends on the immutable goal, frozen
scope/principles, applicable upstream topic outputs, approved
technology/configuration, and governance/traceability controls.
Dependency Type Blocking where safety, authority, scope, correctness,
determinism, security, baseline integrity, or required evidence is
material; otherwise downstream/read-only. Parallelization Eligibility
Independent read-only analysis, evidence preparation, fixtures,
non-conflicting implementation, and documentation may proceed in
parallel after governing inputs and interfaces are frozen.
Parallelization Restrictions No bypass of blocking dependencies; no
conflicting authoritative writes; no baseline weakening; no goal/scope
redefinition; no fabricated evidence; no silent overwrite. Technical
Details Use stable IDs, versioned contracts, explicit states,
deterministic rules where required, dependency links, correlation IDs,
controlled configuration, reproducible run metadata, durable evidence,
access control, and controlled branch/merge mechanisms. Tools /
Resources Approved repository/version control, test framework, CI/CD,
observability/audit tooling, schema validation, and only the
data/API/tooling approved by Topic 7. Constraints Must remain within the
frozen hierarchy, approved system goal, PoV scope, safety boundaries,
permissions, and environment restrictions.

Field Specification Prohibited Actions Do not invent missing
requirements, silently change numbering, bypass risk/approval controls,
fabricate progress/evidence, or grant unauthorized execution authority.
Expected Behaviour Produce deterministic, auditable, evidence-backed
results; expose progress, blockers, failures and state; preserve prior
validated state. Error Handling Validate inputs and dependencies; retry
only explicitly retryable failures; isolate invalid outputs; preserve
evidence; enter safe/blocked state when reliable processing is not
possible. Blocked-State Conditions Blocked when required inputs,
dependencies, authority, evidence, validation, safety, or interface
compatibility for Parallel Development Change Control are missing,
invalid, failed, or unavailable. Unblocking Conditions Resume only after
the blocking condition is corrected, dependency/state is revalidated,
and required evidence is available. Human Escalation Escalate when the
condition requires protected-governance authority, unresolved ambiguity,
critical safety/security intervention, or an approval explicitly
classified as human-required. Validation Method Validate Parallel
Development Change Control against its defined schema, rules,
dependencies, evidence, acceptance criteria, and relevant
upstream/downstream contracts. Testing Requirements Test normal,
boundary, invalid-input, dependency-failure, stale/inconsistent-state,
recovery, authorization, and relevant integration scenarios. Evidence
Required Retain inputs, versions, calculations/rules, outputs, test
results, logs, decisions, approvals, and trace/correlation identifiers
relevant to Parallel Development Change Control. Acceptance Criteria
Parallel Development Change Control is accepted only when required
functionality/specification, validation, evidence, dependencies,
security/safety constraints, and applicable tests pass. Failure /
Rejection Criteria Reject when required evidence is missing, rules are
violated, dependencies are unresolved, output is invalid, or a
release-blocking safety/security/correctness condition fails. Recovery /
Corrective Action Correct the underlying condition, re-run affected
validation/tests, reconcile state, preserve evidence, and return only to
the last validated state where appropriate. Audit / Traceability Record
all material lifecycle events for Parallel Development Change Control,
including creation, evaluation, changes, failures, approvals, recovery,
and final status, linked by requirement/version/trace identifiers.
Change Control Changes to Parallel Development Change Control shall use
controlled change request, impact assessment, testing, approval where
required, version creation, audit logging, and post-change validation.
Rationale / Assumptions This specification preserves the user's frozen
hierarchy while making the item implementation-ready without introducing
artificial child numbering. Verification Method Independent review plus
automated/schema/test evidence shall verify that Parallel Development
Change Control is complete, consistent, traceable, testable, and
correctly integrated.
